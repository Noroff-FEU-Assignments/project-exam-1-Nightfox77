A Travel Blog with content drawn from a WordPress Rest API

## Description

After learning how to use WordPress and how to use it as a API, I started working on this travel blog.
I added the pictures and content as products in WooCommerce and then fetched it from there.

- ## On the homepage
  I created a gallery that changes automatically every few seconds.
  The section ``Latest Blogs``shows 4 Blogs and on click of the left/right arrows more blogs are loaded.
  The arrows disappear if there are no more blogs to be loaded
  
- ## On the blogs page
  Here the 10 first blogs are loaded and on click of the plus icon the next 10 are loaded

- ## On the single blog page
  The image opens on clicking a modal that reveals a bigger view of that image
  I also prepared a comment section to send comments and eventually display them

- ## On the About page
  I did nothing special here just added a picture and some information

- ## On the contact page
  I added a form and a validation process. The button enables when all requirements are met.
  

## Built With
- Html
- CSS
- Javascript
- WordPress
- Rest API
- Headless CMS


### Installing

This is where you list how to get the project started. It typically just includes telling a person to clone the repo and then to install the dependencies e.g.

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:NoroffFEU/portfolio-1-example.git
```
